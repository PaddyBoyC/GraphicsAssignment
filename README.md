A final project of all that we learnt from computer graphics programming and simulation programming. This simulation was made by applying interpolation, simple numerical integration and Newtonian mechanics to basic 2D and 3D shapes. For this project, I produced a small-scale version of the solar system where all the planets/stars/moons had some funky physics.
